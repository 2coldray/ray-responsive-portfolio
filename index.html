              Hello! My name is Rayshawn Bray. I am 24 years old and I was born
              and raised in Atlanta, Georgia. Growing up, I loved listening to
              music, playing sports and video games. I’ve played football,
              basketball, baseball and did a year of track in high school. I
              love playing video games like Madden NFL Football and NBA 2k.
              Hanging out with my friends is also among one of my favorite
              things to do. I graduated college at Georgia State University where
              I received a BS degree in Neuroscience. At the time, I wanted to
              go medical school but ultimately made the decision not to.
              Instead, I leaned on math background and wanted to become a Data
              Scientist. I always loved statistics and the really cool insights
              you could gain through advanced analytics. That is what led me to
              Syracuse’s Applied Data Science program that I started not to long
              after graduating college.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              While in the program, I discovered a new passion of mine which is
              coding! This has led me to exploring various careers where I could
              code and visually see the results. Now, my career goal is to
              become a full stack web developer! I wanted to attend Georgia
              Tech’s Full Stack Web Developer bootcamp because it gives me
              structure and all the skills needed to go into the field. I look
              forward to starting my career after completion of the bootcamp!
