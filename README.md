# HW-02 My Responsive Portfolio 

## Description

The purpose of the assignment was to create a responsive portfolio web application that is readable on multiple devices. This is important 50% of users who use the internet do so on mobile devices, not just computers. This means that web applications have to be functional on the screens that are large and small. If not, it's possible to lose users of your application. To start, three separate HTML files were created for three sections of the webpage; About Me, Portfolio, and Contacts. CSS sheets were also created for each HTML file. For each page, Bootstrap was used to create headers, footers, forms, and other Bootstrap classes were used for customizing each page. The About Me page, contains a personal image and paragraph with text wrapping around the image describing my background. The Portfolio Page, has 5 placeholder images to display my future projects. The Contacts Page contains a form where a user can enter their name, email address, and message before submitting the form to contact me. All the pages are linked. If a user clicks, any of the links in the NavBar, it will take them to that page. When the screen size changes, so does the layout of the page.
