## Description

The purpose of the assignment was to create a responsive portfolio web application that is readable on multiple devices. This is important because 50% of users who use the internet do so on mobile devices, not just computers. This means that web applications have to be functional on the screens that are large and small. If not, it's possible to lose users of your application. To start, three separate HTML files were created for three sections of the webpage; About Me, Portfolio, and Contacts. CSS sheets were also created for each HTML file. For each page, Bootstrap and CSS was used to create headers, footers, forms, and other Bootstrap classes were used for customizing each page. The About Me page, contains a personal image and paragraph with text wrapping around the image describing my background. The Portfolio Page, has 5 placeholder images to display my future projects. The Contacts Page contains a form where a user can enter their name, email address, and message before submitting the form to contact me. All the pages are linked. If a user clicks any of the links in the NavBar, it will take them to that page. When the screen size changes, so does the layout of the page.

## Installation

1. To access, the code repository, go to this website: https://github.com/2coldray/ray-responsive-portfolio .

    within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
    wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
    of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
    do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
    notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
    or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
    that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
    as modifying the License.

7.  Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
    agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
    Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
    WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
    implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
    of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
    PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
    appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
    risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

8.  Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
    whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
    unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
    negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
    liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
    incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
    result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
    Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
